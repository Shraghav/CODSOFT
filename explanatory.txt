So basically we are copying the files from github, but we are not tracking (i.e, whenever we are adding the files). 

Local to Git -> git add, git commit , git push 
So we just add the files to git and next pushing to the repository. After we added the file it will go to stagging area
add doesn't mean we are adding a file. It just mentioned the changes made to stagging area
for deleting a file do the steps as same as adding a file

Git to local -> git pull
