So basically we are copying the files from github, but we are not tracking (i.e, whenever we are adding the files). 

Use git init to init
Local to Git -> git add, git commit , git push 
So we just add the files to git and next pushing to the repository. After we added the file it will go to stagging area
add doesn't mean we are adding a file. It just mentioned the changes made to stagging area
for deleting a file do the steps as same as adding a file

Git to local -> git pull

Creating a new Folder with respect to git
What we will do here first create a repository
Next we will  create a local Folder
Initializing a git so that we could deploy them in the created repository
Now we are adding files and committing.
Then we are using remote add origin (because there is no branch available as of now) remember to copy the http link
If we use git push origin main , it will not work properly because the branch name is changed
So either we could use the changed branch name or we could change the branch name and use it.
To remove the add orgin in remote , use git remote rm origin
After pushing the work is done!
