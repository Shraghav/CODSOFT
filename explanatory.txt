So basically we are copying the files from github, but we are not tracking (i.e, whenever we are adding the files). 
So we just add the files to git and next pushing to the repository. After we added the file it will go to stagging area

add doesn't mean we are adding a file. It just mentioned the changes made to stagging area
for deleting a file do the steps as same as adding a file
